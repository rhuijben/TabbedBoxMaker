PROJECT STATE: Material Size Limits & Piece Splitting Implementation
====================================================================
Date: June 22, 2025
Status: Core Requirements Complete, Smart Overlap System Implemented

VERIFIED DESIGN DECISIONS:
==========================

âœ… 1. GEOMETRIC INTEGRITY PRESERVATION:
   - Combined split pieces must be geometrically identical to original piece
   - All external cuts, tabs, slots must align perfectly when assembled
   - Internal divider holes and features must maintain proper spacing
   - Kerf compensation applied consistently across all split pieces
   - STATUS: Foundation implemented, geometric validation pending

âœ… 2. PIECE SIZE OPTIMIZATION (25% RULE):
   - No split piece smaller than 25% of maximum material dimension
   - Prevents unusably small pieces difficult to handle/cut
   - May require adjusting split positions or increasing piece count
   - Balances minimizing pieces vs maintaining usable sizes
   - STATUS: FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED âœ“

âœ… 3. SMART THICKNESS-BASED OVERLAP:
   - Overlap automatically scales with material thickness for consistency
   - Minimum overlap = 1.0x thickness (ensures adequate joining material)
   - Default overlap = 3.5x thickness (balanced strength and efficiency)
   - Maximum overlap = 6.0x thickness (prevents excessive material waste)
   - Works proportionally across all material types and thicknesses
   - STATUS: FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED âœ“

âœ… 4. INTELLIGENT OVERLAP PLACEMENT:
   - Overlap regions positioned to avoid critical tab/slot areas
   - External geometry preserved (tabs that connect to other pieces)
   - Split boundaries adjusted to maintain joint integrity
   - Different strategies needed for different join types
   - STATUS: Framework in place, smart positioning pending

âœ… 5. SVG LAYOUT INTEGRATION:
   - Split pieces placed adjacent to each other in SVG output
   - Other box pieces shifted right to accommodate split piece groups
   - Clear labeling for assembly identification
   - Maintains existing layout algorithms where possible
   - STATUS: Basic framework, layout positioning pending

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
======================

COMPLETED COMPONENTS:
--------------------

âœ… CORE ARCHITECTURE:
   - JoinType enum with comprehensive documentation
   - Material size limit constants with usage examples
   - SplitInfo and SplitPiece dataclasses with enhanced fields
   - BoxDesign integration with material limit parameters
   - BoxMakerCore integration with splitting logic

âœ… SMART THICKNESS-BASED OVERLAP SYSTEM:
   - MIN_OVERLAP_MULTIPLIER = 1.0 (never less than thickness)
   - DEFAULT_OVERLAP_MULTIPLIER = 3.5 (balanced default)
   - MAX_OVERLAP_MULTIPLIER = 6.0 (prevents excessive waste)
   - Automatic clamping to valid range in check_material_limits()
   - CLI and Inkscape extension updated with 1.0-6.0 range
   - Comprehensive testing across material types and extreme values

âœ… DETECTION & VALIDATION:
   - check_material_limits() with intelligent split direction selection
   - 25% minimum piece size constraint enforcement (TESTED)
   - Piece dimension calculation for all box components
   - Priority-based splitting (height > width to minimize piece count)
   - Configurable overlap calculation with safety minimums

âœ… SPLIT GENERATION FRAMEWORK:
   - generate_split_pieces() method structure
   - Proper piece sequencing (first/middle/last with appropriate overlaps)
   - Split piece tracking and identification for assembly
   - Framework for join geometry addition

âœ… CLI/UI INTEGRATION:
   - Command line arguments for material size limits
   - Inkscape extension parameters for material constraints
   - Help text and usage examples for different equipment types
   - Parameter validation and error handling

âœ… TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE:
   - Comprehensive test suite covering detection and splitting
   - 25% minimum size rule validation (ALL TESTS PASS)
   - Thickness-based overlap limits testing (ALL TESTS PASS)
   - Edge case testing (large boxes, thin materials, no limits)
   - Extreme multiplier clamping validation (ALL TESTS PASS)
   - Real-world material scenario testing (ALL TESTS PASS)
   - SVG generation validation with split pieces
   - Performance testing with complex designs

PENDING IMPLEMENTATION:
----------------------

ðŸ”„ SMART OVERLAP PLACEMENT:
   Priority: HIGH (affects geometric integrity)
   
   REQUIRED:
   - Tab/slot position analysis along split directions
   - Safe zone detection (areas without critical geometry)
   - Split boundary adjustment algorithms
   - Conflict detection and resolution

ðŸ”„ SVG LAYOUT POSITIONING:
   Priority: MEDIUM (affects usability)
   
   REQUIRED:
   - Split piece group positioning
   - Adjacent placement of related pieces
   - Layout shifting for other components
   - Clear piece labeling and identification

ðŸ”„ ADVANCED JOIN TYPES:
   Priority: LOW (enhancement)
   
   PLANNED:
   - SQUARES: Simple rectangular tabs
   - DOVETAIL: Angled interlocking joints
   - FINGER_JOINT: Box joint implementation
   - FINGER_JOINT: Alternating tab/slot pattern

NEXT DEVELOPMENT PHASE:
======================

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Implement safe zone detection for tab/slot positions
2. Add split boundary adjustment algorithms
3. Create SVG layout positioning for split pieces
4. Add comprehensive integration testing

This implementation provides a solid foundation for material-constrained
box generation with all key design decisions validated and core functionality
tested. Ready for next development phase.
