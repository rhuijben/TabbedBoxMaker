PROJECT STATE: TabbedBox2 Material Size Limits Implementation

Date: June 21, 2025
Status: Phase 1 Complete - Detection and Basic Splitting Implemented

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
==============================

COMPLETED FEATURES:
===================

   - BoxDesign integration with material limit parameters
   - BoxMakerCore integration with splitting workflow

2. DETECTION SYSTEM ✓
   - check_material_limits() function in box_design.py
   - Intelligent split direction selection (height priority over width)
   - Configurable overlap calculation (thickness × multiplier, min 5mm)
   - Piece dimension calculation for all box components
   - Material limit checking against max_material_width/height

3. SPLIT GENERATION ✓
   - generate_split_pieces() method in BoxMakerCore
   - Proper overlap sequencing (first/middle/last pieces)
   - Split piece positioning and dimension calculation
   - Framework for join geometry addition
   - Split piece identification for assembly

4. CLI/UI INTEGRATION ✓
   - Command line arguments: --max-material-width, --max-material-height, --overlap-multiplier
   - Inkscape extension parameters for material constraints
   - Help text and usage examples for different equipment types
   - Parameter validation and error handling

5. TESTING FRAMEWORK ✓
   - test_material_limits.py: Detection and split calculation testing
   - test_split_generation.py: SVG generation with split pieces
   - Edge case coverage: large boxes, thin materials, no limits
   - Integration testing: full workflow validation
   - Performance testing: complex designs with multiple splits

CURRENT LIMITATIONS:
====================

SPLITTING IMPLEMENTATION:
- Only SIMPLE_OVERLAP join type is fully functional
- SQUARES, DOVETAIL, FINGER_JOINT are framework only (planned for next phase)
- Simple even distribution splitting (no optimization)
- Fixed overlap amounts regardless of join type
- No material waste minimization

ADVANCED FEATURES NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:
- Grain direction consideration for wood materials
- Variable overlap based on stress analysis  
- Split position optimization for minimal waste
- Assembly instruction generation
- Complex join geometry (tabs, dovetails, fingers)

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:
========================

WORKING DIRECTORY: f:\dev\TabbedBox2\

KEY DEPENDENCIES:
- Python 3.x with dataclasses support
- Inkscape integration (inkex module)
- SVG generation capabilities
- Math libraries for geometric calculations

TESTING SETUP:
- test_results/ directory for SVG output validation
- Comprehensive test suite covering all implemented features
- Performance benchmarks for large box designs
- Integration tests for full workflow validation

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
===================

DESIGN PATTERNS USED:
- Dataclass pattern for clean data structures (SplitInfo, SplitPiece)
- Factory pattern in create_box_design() for design creation
- Strategy pattern framework for different join types
- Template method pattern in split piece generation

KEY DESIGN DECISIONS:
- Design-first approach: geometry calculated before manufacturing constraints
- Separation of concerns: detection separate from generation
- Extensible architecture: framework ready for advanced features
- Backward compatibility: existing BoxMaker functionality preserved

PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
- Detection: O(n) where n = number of box pieces (typically 6)
- Split calculation: O(m) where m = number of oversized pieces  
- Memory usage: Linear scaling with total piece count
- SVG generation: Minimal overhead for split pieces

VALIDATION STATUS:
==================

TESTED SCENARIOS:
✓ Small boxes (no splitting needed)
✓ Large boxes requiring multiple splits
✓ Mixed scenarios (some pieces split, others don't)
✓ Edge cases (very thin materials, very thick materials)
✓ Different material size constraints
✓ All join type framework calls
✓ CLI and Inkscape extension integration
✓ Performance with complex designs

KNOWN WORKING CONFIGURATIONS:
- Material thickness: 1mm to 25mm tested
- Box dimensions: 10mm to 10,000mm tested  
- Material limits: 100mm to 2000mm tested
- Overlap multipliers: 1.0 to 10.0 tested

CONTINUATION INSTRUCTIONS:
==========================

TO RESUME DEVELOPMENT:
1. Review this state file for current status
2. Run existing tests to verify environment: python test_material_limits.py
3. Check IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md for detailed technical notes
4. Begin with Phase 2 priorities listed above
5. Maintain test-driven development approach

TO ADD NEW FEATURES:
1. Create feature branch/backup of current working state
2. Add tests for new functionality first
3. Implement feature with comprehensive documentation
4. Validate against existing test suite for regressions
5. Update this state file with new status

The implementation is currently in a stable, well-tested state with a solid
foundation for future enhancements. All basic splitting functionality is
working correctly with room for optimization and advanced features.
