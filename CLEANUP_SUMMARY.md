# Cleanup and CI Integration Summary

## Files Removed
- `final_test.py` - Redundant demo file (functionality covered by `demo_complete_workflow.py`)

## Dead Code Removed from `boxmaker_core.py`
The following legacy methods have been removed since their functionality has been moved to `box_design.py`:

- `_parse_compartment_sizes()` - Now handled by `parse_compartment_sizes()` in `box_design.py`
- `_calculate_divider_positions()` - Now handled by `calculate_divider_configuration()` in `box_design.py`
- `_get_custom_spacing()` - No longer needed, spacing is calculated in design phase

Only kept:
- `_get_divider_position()` - Still needed for SVG generation, now simplified to use pre-calculated positions

## CI Integration
Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to include:

### Main CI Job
- `python test_boxmaker.py` - Main test suite
- `python test_design.py` - **New design system tests**
- `python test_updated_core.py` - **Updated core integration tests**
- `python cli_examples.py` - CLI examples

### Inkscape Version Test
- `python test_boxmaker.py` - Main test suite
- `python test_design.py` - **New design system tests**
- `python cli_examples.py` - CLI examples

### Cross-Platform Tests
- `python test_boxmaker.py` - Main test suite  
- `python test_design.py` - **New design system tests**

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner codebase** - Removed ~100 lines of duplicate/obsolete code
2. **Better test coverage** - Design system now tested in CI pipeline
3. **Separation of concerns** - Clear boundary between design calculation and generation
4. **CI validation** - All new features automatically tested on multiple platforms

## Files Kept
All important files retained:
- `test_boxmaker.py` - Main test suite (as requested)
- `test_design.py` - New design system tests (now in CI)
- `test_updated_core.py` - Integration tests (now in CI)
- `test_generation_comprehensive.py` - Comprehensive generation tests (for development)
- `cli_examples.py` - CLI usage examples (as requested)
- `demo_complete_workflow.py` - Complete workflow demonstration
- `demo_box_types.py` - Box type dimension effects demonstration

The codebase is now cleaner and the design system is properly integrated into the CI pipeline for continuous validation.
