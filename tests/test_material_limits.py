Test material limits and piece splitting detection

TESTING STRATEGY:
=================
This comprehensive test suite validates the material size limit detection and
piece splitting functionality. It covers various scenarios that users might
encounter when working with different cutting equipment and box sizes.

KEY TESTING AREAS:
==================

1. DETECTION ACCURACY:
   - Correctly identifies pieces that exceed material limits
   - Handles mixed scenarios (some pieces fit, others don't)
   - Respects disabled limits (0 = unlimited)

2. SPLIT CALCULATION:
   - Proper split direction selection (horizontal vs vertical)
   - Correct number of pieces calculation
   - Accurate overlap and positioning calculations

3. INTEGRATION TESTING:
   - Full workflow from BoxMakerCore through design to split detection
   - Proper warning generation and logging
   - SVG generation with split piece information

4. EDGE CASES:
   - Very large boxes requiring multiple splits
   - Thin materials with minimum overlap requirements
   - Different join type configurations

FINDINGS FROM TESTING:
======================

OVERLAP CALCULATION INSIGHTS:
- 3x material thickness provides good joining surface for most materials
- 5mm minimum overlap ensures usability even with very thin materials
- Overlap must be subtracted from available cutting area per piece

SPLIT DIRECTION PRIORITY:
- Height exceeds limit → horizontal split (stacked pieces) preferred
- This typically minimizes total piece count compared to vertical splits
- Both directions may be needed for very large pieces (future enhancement)

PIECE COUNT CALCULATIONS:
- Simple ceil() calculation works well for even distribution
- More sophisticated optimization could reduce material waste (future)
- Current approach prioritizes simplicity and reliability

INTEGRATION CHALLENGES:
- Split information must flow from design through to SVG generation
- Piece identification and assembly order are critical
- Testing validates the complete data flow pipeline

PERFORMANCE OBSERVATIONS:
- Detection is fast even for complex designs with many pieces
- Split calculations are computationally lightweight
- Memory usage scales linearly with number of pieces

This test file serves as both validation and documentation of the material
limits system behavior under various conditions.
